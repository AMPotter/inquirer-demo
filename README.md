# inquirer-demo

This is an adaptation of a game (which I haven't played) called Space Explorer, which was made by a group of students in the school I work for.

As a teaching assistant, I need to learn Inquirer so I can help a couple of the groups who are using the package for their midterm projects.

This is currently a WIP, I've only started building it in earnest today (as of writing this), constructing the models, user authorization, and some rudimentary routes. Once it's workable, I'll update this README with instructions for running it yourself.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub!
